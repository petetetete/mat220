# Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning Programs

A collection of programs used to assist in solving the 
[problems](http://danaernst.com/teaching/mat220s18/220ProblemCollection.pdf)
presenting in MAT 220 (Spring 18). These programs were written in Python
to maximize their readibility. They also do not necessarily directly answer
the questions as they provide no mathematical reasoning, they were mostly
created to improve understanding of the problem or to glean new insight.

## Problems

* [Problem 35](problem35.py)
* [Problem 41/42](problem41_42.py)
* [Problem 56](problem56.py)
